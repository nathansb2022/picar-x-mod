# PiCar-X Examples

This was forked from the main project [Picar-x](https://github.com/Sunfounder/picar-x.git).These are the python scripts to interact with your picar.

## About this kit

Added 00.my_car.py that includes the driving functions with camera movement. Also, I put in the music feature and the ability to talk via the command line. Lastly, I have added the file picarAssistant.py that has ChatGPT functionality with the picar.txt as the functionality. Does require a small usb microphone to interact.
